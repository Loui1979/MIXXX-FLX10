Mix Controls
  In the Pioneer DDJ-FLX10 JavaScript mapping for Mixxx  handlers are JavaScript functions that process incoming MIDI signals from the controller or respond to changes in Mixxx's internal state (e.g., via engine callbacks). They calculate actions or outputs based on MIDI data (status, control, value) and use mathematical multipliers (e.g., padMultiplier = 0x08) to derive pad modes/pages without hardcoding. This keeps the code efficient and tied to the controller's hex patterns.
Groups are string identifiers like [Channel1] or [Sampler1] that represent Mixxx components (decks, samplers, etc.). They organize controls (e.g., play, hotcue_1_enabled) and are used in functions like engine.setValue(group, key, value) to target specific decks. In our script, groups are derived dynamically from MIDI status bytes (e.g., 0x90 for Channel 1), allowing deck-specific actions without explicit switching.
Key Handlers






///////////////////////////////   
Groups and Containers

Groups like [Channel1] are used throughout for deck targeting (e.g., in engine.getValue(group, 'hotcue_1_color') for LED colors).
We use components.ComponentContainer for organization: 4 channelContainers (one per group) group elements like VU meters; 4 padContainers nest pad logic per channel. This modularizes code without deck switching, as MIDI channels map directly to groups.

Everything that doesn't need logic, or the logic is performed by mix or the controller is simply mapped in the xml. This approach minimizes XML (only for non-pad inputs like jog touch or mode buttons) and maximizes built-ins for reliability, per Mixxx wiki/docs on MIDI scripting. For full details, see Mixxx's MIDI Scripting wiki.


Here is a list of included (options) that are functions already included in Mixxx



///////////////////////					//////////////
padInputHandler: Called on pad MIDI input (NOTE/CC). Derives group from status, computes page/pad via multipliers (e.g., relativeControl = control - (modeIndex * padMultiplier * 2)), and triggers built-ins (e.g., engine.setValue(group, 'hotcue_' + cueNum + '_activate', 1) for hotcues). No XML needed; registered in init() with midi.makeInputHandler.
jogInputHandler: Processes jog rotation CC (e.g., control 0x22 for vinyl scratch). Derives group from status, calculates delta (value - 64), and applies built-ins like engine.scratchTick(channelNum, delta) or engine.setValue(group, 'jog', delta * bendScale).
updatePadLed / updateJogRing / updateJogDisplay: Engine-connected callbacks (via engine.connectControl(group, key, handler)) for outputs. E.g., updatePadLed recomputes MIDI control with multipliers, maps colors (1-127), and sends via midi.sendShortMsg(status, midiControl, colorValue).
setPadMode: From XML-bound mode buttons; updates padModes[group] and refreshes LEDs.

[ChannelN]hotcue_X_activate
[PreviewDeckN]hotcue_X_activate
[SamplerN]hotcue_X_activate
If hotcue X is not set, this sets a hotcue at the current play position and saves it as hotcue X of type “Hotcue”. In case a loop is currently enabled (i.e. if [ChannelN],loop_enabled is set to 1), the loop will be saved as hotcue X instead and hotcue_X_type will be set to “Loop”. If hotcue X has been set as a regular cue point, the player seeks to the saved play position.
If hotcue_X_type is “Loop”, looping will be enabled and the loop controls (e.g. loop_start_position, loop_end_position and beatloop_size) will be set accordingly. Just like reloop_toggle, the player seeks back to the loop start when the current play position is behind the loop, and enabled without a seek when it is in front of or inside the loop. This allows a loop catching behavior on one hand and a jump back when the loop has been exit by just triggering this control.
Setting the control to 1 when the track is currently not playing (i.e. play is set to 0) will start hotcue previewing. After resetting the control to 0, playback will usually be stopped and the player will seek to the hotcue position. If play is set to 1 while previewing is active, the playback will continue and no seek occurs.

Range : binary
Feedback : Player may change position. Hotcue X marker may change on waveform.
